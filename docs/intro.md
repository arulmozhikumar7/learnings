# 👋 Hey, I'm Arulmozhikumar K

This is my personal space where I write down stuff I’m learning — tech, tools, ideas — basically anything I want to remember or figure out better.

Some things might be right, some might be wrong. It’s all part of the process.

---

## 📓 What you'll find here

- Notes on concepts I'm exploring
- Code snippets and walkthroughs
- Things I broke (and how I fixed them)
- Just general learnings, mostly tech

> These aren’t polished tutorials. I’m just thinking out loud.

That’s it. Nothing fancy.  
I'll keep updating this as I go ✌️
